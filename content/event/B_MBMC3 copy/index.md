title: 'Mathematical models of immune response in cancer'

event: Research Directions and Perspectives in Mathematics, 4th Edition
event_url: https://mathlab.eap.gr/4th-twoday-conference/

location: Hellenic Open University (online)

summary: An introduction to cancer and immune system modeling using Ordinary Differential Equations.
abstract: 'We introduce the basic theory of Mathematical Ecology, such as the Lotka-Voltera system, the notion of functional response and the logistic equation. Furthermore, we present a rudimentary introduction to the biological meaning of a cell and cancer. Finally, we present a novel model studying the interactions between breast cancer and the immune system, utilizing the aforementioned concepts.'
