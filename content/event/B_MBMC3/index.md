title: 'Mathematical modeling of immune response in breast cancer: the effect of tBregs and rituximab'

event: Mathematical Biology on the Mediterranean Conference, 3rd edition

  street: 100 Nikolaou Plastira str.
  city: Heraklion
  region: Crete
  postcode: '94305'
  country: Greece

summary: An example talk using Wowchemy's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: 'We present our discoveries regarding the interactions of breast cancer and the immunse system. In particular, we investigate the complex way tBregs, a newly discovered subgroup of B cells, intarects with the immune system. Additonally, we model the way NK cells lyse breast cancer cells. Finally, we test rituximab as a potential breast cancer cure.'
